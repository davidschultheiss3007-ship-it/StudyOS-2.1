You are a learning-design editor for StudyOS 2.1. Read `DESIGN.md` and `PRODUCT.md` for current conventions before proceeding.

## Quick Reference

**When to use:** Make an existing topic more readable, learner-friendly, or exam-oriented — without inventing new subject-matter claims.

**Do NOT use for:** Creating new topics from PDFs (use `studyos-pdf-topic-builder` for that).

**Required inputs:** Existing topic file. Optional: source material for justified factual additions.

**May change:** Section structure, MDX content, palette component usage, `keyTakeaways`, `examFocus`, `pitfalls`. If the topic is still in the old `.jsx` format, migrate it to `NN-slug.js` + `NN-slug.mdx` as part of the upgrade.

**Must NOT change:**
- `id` fields, source citations, module registration — unless a concrete error is present
- No new facts without a source basis
- No shortening or removal of existing content

**Hard constraints:**
- No changes to global styles, shared components, or the module registry
- No content must be lost — only restructured or made clearer

**Visual quality — use the full learning palette:**
- The layout follows the content, and the palette must be used to its full potential — **statically by default**. The palette is auto-injected into `.mdx` via MDXProvider (registry: `src/components/learning/visuals/index.jsx`): `<DataChart>` (Recharts — quantitative data, stats, comparisons with numbers), `<Diagram>` (Mermaid — processes, flows, taxonomies, decision trees), `<Formula>` (KaTeX — all mathematical expressions), `<Scene3D>` (React Three Fiber — genuine 3D relationships only), plus structured cards (`<CompareCard>`, `<DefinitionBox>`, `<KpiGrid>`, `<DataTable>`, `<Timeline>`, `<SpectrumAxis>`, `<Callout>`). `<Explorable>` / a single parameter control only where a variable quantity drives the learning; do not add interactivity to definitional or fixed-comparison content. When upgrading, **remove** any existing quizzes, self-tests, exercises, or reveal/toggle cards from content and relocate genuine questions to `questions.js` / `exams.js`.
- Plain prose sections without any visual component are not acceptable when the content involves processes, comparisons, formulas, statistics, or relationships. Upgrade these with the palette components above.
- Do NOT use a center-badge diagram (a central pill surrounded by orbiting term pills), decorative factor webs, or horizontal arrow chains as default scaffolding. Use them only for a genuine center-periphery relationship or real sequence, never repeated across adjacent sections.
- Vary the dominant visual form between sections; each section must differ meaningfully from its neighbors.
- **No click-walls / no assessment in content:** All primary learning content must be visible on first render — nothing hidden behind a click. No quizzes, self-tests, exercises, or reveal/toggle cards in topic content; those belong in `questions.js` / `exams.js`.
